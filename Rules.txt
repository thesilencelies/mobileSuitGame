Version 0.2

these rules set out a method of handling movement and combat between mobile suits. win condtions and extra rules can be decided on a per mission basis. with many players teams are reccomended over battle royale due to the necessity of focussed attacks to actually kill anything.

Each player has some number of mobile suits (henceforth MS) each of which has it’s own deck of cards that go with it (the rules for deck construction are at the end)
the battle is fought on a hex-tri grid. Each MS has a hexagonal base that will occupy exactly 6 of the triangles on the grid.
distances are reckoned from the edge of this base, everything is measured in steps of triangles - motion is between the vertexes of the triangles.

setup
each player places their MS at the starting locations, shuffles 
the decks, and a player recieves the priority marker.

turn
on each turn of the game there are 2 phases: planning and action.

in the planning phase, simulatbaeously for each MS 5 cards are drawn from it’s deck, and from those 2 are chosen and placed facedown. the rest of the cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.
each deck has one marked card in it - if that card would be drawn, instead the deck is shuffled.

at the start of the action phase all the face down cards are turned face up.

cards are resolved in order of the initiative value, starting with the highest. in the event of a tie, players take it in turns to choose one card at the current intiative to resolve, starting with the player with the priority marker and moving clockwise.
